To illustrate how an RPC service could be used we're going to create a simple client class.
It's going to expose a method named call which sends an RPC request and blocks until the answer is received:


fibonacci_rpc = FibonacciRpcClient()
result = fibonacci_rpc.call(4)
print("fib(4) is %r" % result)
